                Machine learning
 

In terms of advanced technology, one of the most demanding fields is Machine Learning, it is making buzz every day whenever a new product is introduced by any company that deploys ML techniques and algorithms for delivering the consumer in a highly creative manner. 

 

Machine Learning is the technique that gives computers the potential to learn without being programmed, it is actively being used in daily life, machine learning applications in daily life, even without knowing that. Fundamentally, it is the science that enables machines to translate, execute and investigate data for solving real-world problems.

 

With the deployment of complex mathematical expertise, programmers design machine learning algorithms that are coded in a machine language in order to make a complete ML system. By this way, ML enables us to perform tasks to categorize, decipher and estimate data from a given dataset.

 

In the last few years, it has given us self-driving cars, image and speech recognition, useful web search and various extensive applications. It basically converges on the applications that adapt from experience and advance their decision-making potential or predictive accuracy over a period of time.

                Neural Network
 

Incorporating cognitive science and machines to perform tasks, the neural network is a branch of artificial intelligence that makes use of neurology ( a part of biology that concerns the nerve and nervous system of the human brain). Neural network replicates the human brain where the human brain comprises an infinite number of neurons and to code brain-neurons into a system or a machine is what the neural network functions. 

 

In simple terms, a neural network is a set of algorithms that are used to find the elemental relationships across the bunches of data via the process that imitates the human brain operating process.

                Robotics
 

                This has emerged as a very sizzling field of artificial intelligence. An interesting field of research and development mainly focuses on designing and constructing robots. 
                
                 
                
                Robotics is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering incorporated with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and many others. 
                Robotics determines the designing, producing, operating, and usage of robots. It deals with computer systems for their control, intelligent outcomes, and information transformation.
